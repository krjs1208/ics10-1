<p style="font-family:courier;font-size:120%;text-align:center;">The Poodle, called the Pudel in German and the Caniche in French, is a breed of water dog. 
The breed is divided into four varieties based on size, the Standard Poodle, Medium Poodle, Miniature Poodle and Toy Poodle, although the Medium Poodle is not universally recognised. 
They have a distinctive thick, curly coat that comes in many colors and patterns, with only solid colors recognized by breed registries. Poodles are active and intelligent, and are particularly able to learn from humans. Poodles tend to live 10â€“18 years, with smaller varieties tending to live longer than larger ones.</p>

These dogs are naturally active, craving outdoor playtime. Exercising with them brings joy and health. Daily walks, runs, or bike rides deepen your bond and let you savor nature's beauty. This boosts mental well-being and keeps you fit. If you seek an active lifestyle, Peddle dogs are your perfect companions, sharing every wonderful moment with loyalty.
